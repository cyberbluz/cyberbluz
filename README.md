> ## Security to me is more than just a word though.  At 18 years of age, I was handed a uniform and a rifle and told to guard this post.  A few years after college, I was handed a badge, a sidearm, and handcuffs and told to Protect & Serve.<br>Now I am choosing once again to take up the responsibility to Guard, Protect, and Serve the Cyber Community with over 30 years of Security Awarness Training and Investigative Experience.
