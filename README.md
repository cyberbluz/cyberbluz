Security to me is more than just a word though.  At 18 years of age, I was handed a uniform & a rifle and told to guard this post.  Many years later I was handed a badge, a sidearm,  and handcuffs and told to Protect & Serve.  Now I am excited once again to take up the responsibility to Guard, Protect, and Serve the Cybercommunity with over 30 years of Security training and Investigative experience.
