> ## Security is more than just a word to me.  At 18 years of age, I was handed a uniform and a rifle and told to ⚔️ "Guard this Post".  A few years after college, I was handed a badge, a sidearm, and handcuffs and told to 👮🏻 "Protect & Serve".<br>Now, I am choosing to take up the responsibility to Guard, Protect, and Serve the 🖥️ Cyber Community.  My 20 years of Security Awareness Training and Investigative Experience in addition to my current Cybersecurity training make me uniquely qualified to address many of the current challenges in Cybersecurity.
